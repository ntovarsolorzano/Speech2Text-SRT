My scripts that I use to automate stuff, because I hate wasting time. You can use it if it's useful to you.   

## Youtube to SRT using Whisper  
Python script to Get a YouTube URL and return a SRT file in its language (English).   
Edit the 'whisper' model to adjust if language is not English.   
I suggest small, or medium. These are good enough. If you have a beast CPU you can do large.
